[rslhdyt.dev](https://rslhdyt.dev) is my personal website, built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

This website is a reflection of my journey as a software engineer. It is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences, and projects. I have designed it to be a platform for me to express my ideas and connect with the community.

I have built this website with Jekyll, a static site generator, and hosted it on GitHub Pages. I have also used a custom domain to make it more personal.
