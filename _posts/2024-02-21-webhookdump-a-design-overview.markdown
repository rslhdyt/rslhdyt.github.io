description: WebhookDumpÂ is a web application designed to intercept and store HTTP requests for later analysis. Its core functionalities include generating unique URLs for clients, receiving and capturing request data (such as headers and body), and providing real-time monitoring of incoming requests. Initially, the application follows a monolithic structure with a single server, built using Ruby on Rails. The data is stored in an SQLite database, and real-time updates are facilitated through Action Cable, which integrates WebSockets. This technology stack emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and seamless interaction between components. ðŸš€

[WebhookDump](https://webhookdump.link) is a web application engineered to intercept and store HTTP requests for subsequent analysis. It is equipped with three core functionalities:

1. **Unique URL Generation**: Each client is provided with a unique URL.
2. **HTTP Request Reception**: The application is capable of receiving HTTP requests, capturing all pertinent information such as the request body, headers, and more.
3. **Live Monitoring**: This feature enables real-time monitoring of incoming requests, which is crucial for validating the proper operation of your webhooks.

To begin, I will employ a monolithic application structure and a single server to host all necessary components:

1. **Web Server**: Utilizing Ruby on Rails, a server-side web application framework, the system manages incoming HTTP requests. It parses the request data and commits it to the database.
2. **Database**: SQLite, a compact disk-based database, is used to store the parsed HTTP request data. It offers all the required functionality without the complexity of a full-scale server-based database management system.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Action Cable, an integral part of Ruby on Rails, facilitates the integration of WebSockets with the rest of the application. This allows for the development of real-time features in Ruby, which are seamlessly integrated with the server-side logic.

## Technology Selection

The chosen technology stack is characterized by its simplicity, efficiency, and the harmonious interaction of its components:

1. **Ruby with Ruby on Rails**: Ruby, an open-source programming language, emphasizes simplicity and productivity. Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a server-side web application framework developed in Ruby. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, simplifying the management of the applicationâ€™s data, user interface, and control flow.
2. **SQLite**: SQLite is a C library that offers a compact, disk-based database. It eliminates the need for a separate server process and enables database access using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. It is ideal for both development and testing, and even for production in certain scenarios.
3. **WebSocket with Action Cable**: WebSocket establishes a full-duplex communication channel over a single, persistent connection. It is ideal for real-time updates, a requirement for WebhookDump. Action Cable, a component of Rails, simplifies the use of WebSockets in the application.

My objective is to gain a profound understanding of the underlying technology, rather than merely piecing together packages and APIs.

Letâ€™s embark on this journey. ðŸš€
