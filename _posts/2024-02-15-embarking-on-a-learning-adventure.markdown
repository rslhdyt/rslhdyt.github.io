I'm not just building any app, but cloning an existing one to understand its features, challenges, and the technology that powers it. Using a specific tech stack, I'll explore the complexities of webhookdump, from initialize the application to handling the application deployment. This journey is about more than coding; it's about problem-solving, creativity, and continuous learning. Stay tuned as we dive deep into the world of web development together!

Welcome to the first entry in my journey of creating a web application from scratch. This won't be just any application, but a clone of an existing application that many of us use daily. Why a clone, you might ask? The answer is simple: learning.

My primary goal here is not to reinvent the wheel, but to understand how the wheel turns, so to speak. By recreating an existing application, I hope to dive deep into the intricacies of its features, the challenges in its creation, and the technology that powers it.

The application I've chosen to clone is [webhook.site](/d286d4558a4d4ef7ad6d00f4b2b65be5). It's a software that offers a lot of learning opportunities, from managing database and forwarding http request to real-time updates and more.

The technology stack I'll be using for this project includes ruby on rails, websocket and SQLite. I will explain later why I choose those technology. Over the course of this series, I'll be sharing my experiences learning and working with these technologies, the challenges I encounter, and how I overcome them.

This journey is about more than just coding. It's about problem-solving, creative thinking, and continuous learning. It's about understanding the why and how of web application development, not just the what.

In the next blog post, I'll dive into the planning and design phase of the project. I'll be sharing my process for breaking down the application into manageable parts, creating wireframes, and planning the user experience. Stay tuned for an exciting journey into the world of web application development!

Join me as I embark on this exciting journey of discovery and learning. Let's dive deep into the world of web development together!
