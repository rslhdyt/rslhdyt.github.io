description: The process of debugging a Docker container that refuses to run can be challenging, especially when an image fails across various environments due to missing configurations. This article provides a solution to this issue by explaining how to override the ENTRYPOINT using the --entrypoint flag.

Debugging a Docker container that won't run can be hard. It's even harder when an image fails to run in different environments because of missing configurations.

Just recently, I had this problem. My application container wouldn't run in the production environment. After a long night of debugging, I finally found the problem.

```docker
docker run --detach --name app --env-file .env-production docker/image
```

When I run docker run command to run my Rails application with above command. My  Rails application container wouldn't start because the `ENTRYPOINT` command, which sets up the initial database, failed. The application couldn't connect to the PostgreSQL database, so the container stopped at that step.

```docker
# Run and own only the runtime files as a non-root user for security
RUN useradd rails --create-home --shell /bin/bash && \
    chown -R rails:rails db log storage tmp
USER rails:rails

# Entrypoint prepares the database.
ENTRYPOINT ["/rails/bin/docker-entrypoint"]

# Start the server by default, this can be overwritten at runtime
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["./bin/rails", "server"]

```

One solution could be to rebuild the image, remove the `ENTRYPOINT` command, and then debug inside the Docker container. But this can take a lot of time, especially when your Docker image size is large.

Then I learned something new. We can change the `ENTRYPOINT` when we start a Docker container by using the `--entrypoint` flag.

```docker
docker run -it --name app --env-file .env-production --entrypoint bin/bash docker/image
```

With this command, you can directly dive into the Docker container, bypassing the usual entry point. This opens up a new avenue for debugging and identifying missing configurations, saving valuable time and effort.
