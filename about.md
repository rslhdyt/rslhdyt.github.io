<p>Hi there!,</p>

<p>My name is Risal, I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience helping various companies and startups in different industries such as software house, tech education, point of sales, financial services, and digital signature to deliver high-quality applications that meet their specific needs. I take pride in my track record of producing exceptional software solutions that have contributed to the success of these organizations.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time gardening and taking care of my rare plant collection in my greenhouse. It's a relaxing hobby that gives me a break from the fast-paced world of software engineering. I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and connect with new professionals in the industry.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
