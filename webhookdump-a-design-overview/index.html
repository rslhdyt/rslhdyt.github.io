It is equipped with three core functionalities:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Unique URL Generation</strong>: Each client is provided with a unique URL.</li> <li><strong>HTTP Request Reception</strong>: The application is capable of receiving HTTP requests, capturing all pertinent information such as the request body, headers, and more.</li> <li><strong>Live Monitoring</strong>: This feature enables real-time monitoring of incoming requests, which is crucial for validating the proper operation of your webhooks.</li> </ol> <p>To begin, I will employ a monolithic application structure and a single server to host all necessary components:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Web Server</strong>: Utilizing Ruby on Rails, a server-side web application framework, the system manages incoming HTTP requests. It parses the request data and commits it to the database.</li> <li><strong>Database</strong>: SQLite, a compact disk-based database, is used to store the parsed HTTP request data. It offers all the required functionality without the complexity of a full-scale server-based database management system.</li> <li><strong>Real-Time Updates</strong>: Action Cable, an integral part of Ruby on Rails, facilitates the integration of WebSockets with the rest of the application. This allows for the development of real-time features in Ruby, which are seamlessly integrated with the server-side logic.</li> </ol> <h2 id="technology-selection">Technology Selection</h2> <p>The chosen technology stack is characterized by its simplicity, efficiency, and the harmonious interaction of its components:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Ruby with Ruby on Rails</strong>: Ruby, an open-source programming language, emphasizes simplicity and productivity. Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a server-side web application framework developed in Ruby. It adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, simplifying the management of the applicationâ€™s data, user interface, and control flow.</li> <li><strong>SQLite</strong>: SQLite is a C library that offers a compact, disk-based database. It eliminates the need for a separate server process and enables database access using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. It is ideal for both development and testing, and even for production in certain scenarios.</li> <li><strong>WebSocket with Action Cable</strong>: WebSocket establishes a full-duplex communication channel over a single, persistent connection. It is ideal for real-time updates, a requirement for WebhookDump. Action Cable, a component of Rails, simplifies the use of WebSockets in the application.</li> </ol> <p>My objective is to gain a profound understanding of the underlying technology, rather than merely piecing together packages and APIs.</p> <p>Letâ€™s embark on this journey. ðŸš€</p> <div class="grid grid-cols-2 text-sm"> <a class="prev" href="https://rslhdyt.dev/personal-site/">&laquo; rslhdyt.dev</a> <a class="next" href="https://rslhdyt.dev/streamline-your-sidekiq-cron-jobs-with-a-single-worker-class-for-rake-task-invocation/">Streamline Your Sidekiq Cron Jobs with a Single Worker Class for Rake Task Invocation &raquo;</a> </div> <div class="related"> <h4 class="text-xl my-5">Related Posts</h4> <ul class="list-disc list-inside"> <li class="pl-8"> <a href="https://rslhdyt.dev/embarking-on-a-learning-adventure/">Embarking on a Learning Adventure </a> </li> </ul> </div> <footer class="flex justify-center items-center border-solid border-0 border-t border-gray-200 p-10 mt-10"> Risal Hidayat Â© 2024 </footer> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
